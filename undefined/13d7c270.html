<p>A grade of incomplete (“I ) indicates that additional coursework is required to fulfill the requirements of a given course. Students may only be given an “I” grade if they have a passing average in coursework that has been completed and have well-defined parameters to complete the course requirements that could result in a grade better than the default grade. An “I” grade may not be assigned to a student who did not attend the course.</p>
<p>Prior to the end of the semester, students must initiate the request for an “I” grade and receive the instructor’s approval. Assignment of an “I” grade is at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
<p>The instructor must specify a default letter grade at the time the “I” grade is submitted. A default grade is the letter grade the student will receive if no additional coursework is completed and/or a grade change form is not filed by the instructor. “I” grades must be completed within 12 months. Individual instructors may set shorter time limits for removing an incomplete than the 12-month time limit. Upon assigning an “I” grade, the instructor shall provide the student specification, in writing or by electronic mail, of the requirements to be fulfilled, and shall file a copy with the appropriate departmental office. Please read the full <em>Incomplete Policy:</em> <a href="http://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#i-grade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#i-grade</a></p>
<p>Academic Integrity:  <em>Reference to the relevant university Academic Integrity Policy and any additional instructor requirements and comments regarding academic dishonesty.</em></p>
<p>Academic integrity is a fundamental university value. Through the honest completion of academic work, students sustain the integrity of the university while facilitating the university’s imperative for the transmission of knowledge and culture based upon the generation of new and innovative ideas. For a complete outline of the policy and procedures, see here: <a href="https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity</a> .</p>

<p><strong>Public Health Compliance in Classroom setting</strong></p>
<p>As indicated in the Student Compliance Policy for COVID-19 Public Health Behavior Expectations (<a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-weare/departments/conduct/coronavirus-student-compliance-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-weare/departments/conduct/coronavirus-student-compliance-policy.html</a>), in our classroom you are required to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain and wear     masks/face coverings in campus public spaces, including campus outdoor     spaces.</li>
<li>Maintain proper     physical distancing in public spaces and must stay 6 feet apart from one     another.</li>
<li>Stay home if you     are sick.</li>
<li>Abide by New York     State, federal and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) travel     restrictions and precautionary quarantines.</li>
<li>Follow campus and     public health directives for isolation or quarantine. </li>
<li>Should you need to     miss class due to illness, isolation or quarantine, you are required to     notify the course instructor and make arrangements to complete missed     work.</li>
<li>You are responsible     for following any additional directives in settings such as labs, clinical     environments etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students who are not complying with the public health behavior expectations will be asked to comply. Should the non-compliant behavior continue, course instructors are authorized to ask the student to leave the classroom. Non-compliant students may also be referred to the Office of Health Promotion to participate in an online public health class to better educate them on the importance of these public health directives for the entire community.</p>
<p>Diversity and Inclusiveness</p>
<p><em>Openness and tolerance for diverse perspectives—taking the initiative to try to understand points of view that are different from our own:</em></p>
<p><em>Not respecting individual differences (for example culture, gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability status, or age) is perceived as intolerant. Not respecting others in general is a negative attribute and detrimental to the class.  Examples of violations: not respecting or facilitating the input of individuals from different cultural backgrounds, making racist, sexist or otherwise insulting or derogatory comments about a class member; bullying a classmate or engaging in any actions that create a hostile learning environment.</em></p>
<p>Please visit <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/inclusion/resources/IXResources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.buffalo.edu/inclusion/resources/IXResources.html</a>, which details resources, services, events and support related to equity and inclusion for students. </p>
